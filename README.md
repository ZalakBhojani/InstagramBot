<p>
  This script automates the process of uploading photos to instagram while working on a laptop or pc. The script can be run on any machine with chrome installed. Just create a folder named InstaBot in "Pictures" directory of the device and add all the photos to be uploaded.

<p>
This script does not allow the user to add 10 pictures in one post. The script will be updated for it later.

 <h1>Requirements</h1>
 
* pip
* python
* selenium webdriver for chrome
* Enabling Google Nexus 5 in Setting -> More tools -> Developer tools -> Toogle device toolbar -> Resposive -> Edit -> Enable Nexus 5 (scipt would require a mobile device mode enable)

<p>
<p>
  Do try it out  :-)
